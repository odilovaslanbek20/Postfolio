						Hello! My name is Odilov Aslanbek, and I was born on December 20,
						2008. I work in the field of programming, with a strong focus on
						front-end development and creating excellent user experiences. My
						goal is to deliver modern, intuitive, and high-quality websites for
						every client through the projects I build. I constantly strive to
						improve my knowledge and keep up with the latest technologies. I
						also highly value teamwork and collaboration. For me, every project
						is a new opportunity to explore creative and innovative solutions.
